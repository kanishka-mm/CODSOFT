Level 1 Task 1 – Portfolio Website

This folder contains the source code for my personal portfolio website,
developed using HTML and CSS as part of the CODSOFT Web Development Internship.
The project demonstrates my understanding of basic web development concepts
and serves as a showcase of my skills and work.
